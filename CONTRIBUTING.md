## Code Quality

We use `ruff` for linting and `mypy` for type checking:

```bash
# Lint
ruff check flyinghoneybadger/

# Type check
mypy flyinghoneybadger/

# Auto-format
ruff format flyinghoneybadger/
```

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch from `main`
2. Write tests for any new functionality
3. Ensure all tests pass and linting is clean
4. Update documentation if adding new features
5. Submit a PR with a clear description of changes

## Code Style

- Python 3.10+ with type hints on all public APIs
- Line length: 100 characters
- Docstrings on all public classes, methods, and functions
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase (e.g., thread-based scanners, dataclass models)
